Hi, I'm Alexandre Lavoie :nerd_face:

I'm a developer and pentester from [Montreal, QC](https://restaurantlabelleprovince.com/). I'm finishing up my Undergrad in Computer Science at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). I spend most of my weeks concepting, making, and/or breaking software. On weekends, I often participate in CS competitions (Hackathons, CTFs, AI, etc). On my free time, I explore philosophy and psychology, workout, and listen to metal music.
